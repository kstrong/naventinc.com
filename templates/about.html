Navigator traces its origins to 2001, when Ron Teeman formed Navigator Entertainment, during which time he worked 
closely with Paul Barnes and John Banach. In 2005, Teeman formed a special effects company with Paul Barnes (NavFX). 
These two companies shared offices in Southern California. By the spring of 2009, the separate entities merged into 
one unit, Navigator Entertainment Group.

<p>
Since Incorporation in February 2009, Navigator has become a diversified entertainment company with offices in 
Sacramento, California and more recently Seoul, Korea. The company quickly developed a reputation for creating 
and producing one-of-a-kind, innovative projects in all mediums including theme park / themed attractions, 
live entertainment, television, and robotics.
