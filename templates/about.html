Navigator traces its origins to 2001, when Ron Teeman formed Navigator Entertainment, during which time he worked 
closely with Paul Barnes and John Banach. In 2005, Teeman formed a special effects company with Paul Barnes (NavFX). 
These two companies shared offices in Southern California. By the spring of 2009, the separate entities merged into 
one unit, Navigator Entertainment Group.

Since Incorporation in February 2009, Navigator has become a diversified entertainment company with offices in 
Sacramento, California and more recently Seoul, Korea. The company quickly developed a reputation for creating 
and producing one-of-a-kind, innovative projects in all mediums including theme park / themed attractions, 
live entertainment, television, and robotics.
